A project by La Branche : https://discord.gg/AD7H4jX.

The project is in progress, it is therefore normal that for the moment the rules are not implemented on the goban.

## Project architecture
- `GobanSdl.py` is the main script, managing graphical aspects ; the stone capture is not yet functional.

- `GameMaker.py` is a module providing the necessary for the sdl part and the creation of rules (in progress)

- `GameMakerExceptions.py` auxiliary module for `GameMaker`.
